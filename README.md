# SortingInserts
Customizeable 3D printed inserts for storage boxes, originally for Stanley brand "thick" and "thin" toolboxes.

Originally modified from [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1229465), I've rewritten almost all of it. I also added a lot of additional features as well as making it parametric.

It's available on Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4805351

# Features
- No measuring required
- OpenSCAD Customizer friendly
- Custom sizing for rows/columns
- Stackable/nestable without needing to manually calculate heights
- Compatible with "short" and "tall" versions of the container
- Custom dividers with options to skip some
- Minimal plastic needed for "feet"
- Parametric walls, so you can print with larger nozzles effectively
- Parametric sizes, so you can modify it to fit different brands of "insert" style sorting containers  
- **NEW:** You can now make "flip up" compartments that lay flat, then flip vertically
